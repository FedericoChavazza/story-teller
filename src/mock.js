  story:
    "Once upon a time in a quiet forest, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny was known for being very shy and always avoided venturing far from his burrow. One day, while playing near his home, he heard a soft whimpering coming from among the trees. Driven by curiosity and despite his fear, Benny decided to follow the sound. He ventured deeper and deeper into the forest until he found a small squirrel trapped under fallen branches. Remembering what his mother had taught him about helping others, Benny worked hard to free the squirrel. Finally, with much effort, he managed to lift the branches and the squirrel was able to escape. Grateful, the squirrel thanked Benny, who felt very happy and proud for overcoming his fears to help someone in need.",
